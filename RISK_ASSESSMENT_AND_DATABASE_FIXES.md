# Risk Assessment and Database Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Risk Assessment Default Condition Issue
**Problem**: Risk assessment was showing "Upper Respiratory Infection" as a default condition instead of properly analyzing selected symptoms.

**Root Cause**: 
- The `createConditionsFromSymptoms` method had limited symptom-to-condition mapping
- The system was falling back to default conditions when symptom analysis failed
- Limited variety in condition suggestions

**Solution**:
- Enhanced the symptom-to-condition mapping with more comprehensive conditions
- Added more symptoms and conditions to the mapping
- Improved the condition generation logic to ensure multiple conditions are always shown
- Added better fallback conditions for different symptom combinations
- Implemented proper deduplication to avoid repeated conditions

**Changes Made**:
```typescript
// Enhanced symptom mapping with more conditions
const symptomConditionMap = {
  'Headache': [
    { condition: 'Tension Headache', severity: 'mild', urgency: 'low' },
    { condition: 'Migraine', severity: 'moderate', urgency: 'medium' },
    { condition: 'Sinus Headache', severity: 'mild', urgency: 'low' },
    { condition: 'Cluster Headache', severity: 'moderate', urgency: 'medium' }
  ],
  'Cough': [
    { condition: 'Common Cold', severity: 'mild', urgency: 'low' },
    { condition: 'Bronchitis', severity: 'moderate', urgency: 'medium' },
    { condition: 'Allergic Reaction', severity: 'mild', urgency: 'low' },
    { condition: 'Post-Nasal Drip', severity: 'mild', urgency: 'low' }
  ],
  // ... more comprehensive mappings
};
```

### 2. Database Initialization Issue
**Problem**: Health data could not be saved due to "Database not initialized" errors.

**Root Cause**:
- Database initialization was failing silently
- No retry mechanism for failed initialization attempts
- Poor error handling in DataService methods

**Solution**:
- Added retry logic for database initialization (up to 3 attempts)
- Improved error handling in DataService methods
- Added better error messages for users
- Made security service initialization optional (continue even if it fails)

**Changes Made**:
```typescript
// Added retry logic for database initialization
private async performInitialization(): Promise<void> {
  let dbInitSuccess = false;
  let retryCount = 0;
  const maxRetries = 3;
  
  while (!dbInitSuccess && retryCount < maxRetries) {
    try {
      await databaseService.initialize();
      console.log('✅ DataService: Database initialized successfully');
      dbInitSuccess = true;
    } catch (dbError) {
      retryCount++;
      console.warn(`⚠️ DataService: Database initialization attempt ${retryCount} failed:`, dbError);
      
      if (retryCount >= maxRetries) {
        throw new Error(`Database initialization failed after ${maxRetries} attempts`);
      }
      
      // Wait before retrying
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000 * retryCount));
    }
  }
}
```

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/services/RiskAssessmentService.ts`
- Enhanced `createConditionsFromSymptoms` method
- Added more comprehensive symptom-to-condition mappings
- Improved condition generation logic
- Added better fallback conditions

### 2. `src/services/DataService.ts`
- Added retry logic to `performInitialization` method
- Improved error handling in `getHealthData` method
- Enhanced error handling in `saveHealthData` method
- Made security service initialization optional

## Testing Steps

### 1. Test Risk Assessment
1. Navigate to Risk Assessment screen
2. Select multiple symptoms (e.g., Headache, Fatigue, Anxiety)
3. Verify that multiple potential conditions are shown
4. Confirm that conditions are relevant to selected symptoms
5. Check that no single condition is repeated

### 2. Test Health Data Saving
1. Navigate to Health Data screen
2. Fill in health data form
3. Submit the form
4. Verify that data is saved successfully
5. Check that data appears in Health Data History

### 3. Test Database Initialization
1. Restart the application
2. Try to save health data immediately
3. Verify that database initializes properly
4. Check console for initialization logs

## Expected Results

### Risk Assessment
- Should show 2-6 potential conditions based on selected symptoms
- Conditions should be relevant to the symptoms chosen
- No default "Upper Respiratory Infection" unless cough is selected
- Conditions should be sorted by urgency and severity

### Health Data Saving
- Should save data successfully without "Database not initialized" errors
- Should provide clear error messages if issues occur
- Should retry database initialization automatically
- Should continue working even if some services fail to initialize

## Error Handling

### Database Initialization Errors
- System will retry up to 3 times with increasing delays
- Clear error messages will be shown to users
- Application will continue to function even if some services fail

### Risk Assessment Errors
- Fallback to sample assessment if analysis fails
- Multiple conditions will always be shown
- Conditions will be relevant to selected symptoms

## Performance Improvements

### Database Initialization
- Retry logic prevents unnecessary failures
- Graceful degradation when services fail
- Better error reporting for debugging

### Risk Assessment
- More efficient condition mapping
- Better symptom analysis
- Improved user experience with relevant conditions

## Future Enhancements

1. **Dynamic Condition Mapping**: Load condition mappings from external sources
2. **Machine Learning Integration**: Use trained models for better condition prediction
3. **User Feedback**: Allow users to rate condition relevance
4. **Condition History**: Track which conditions were most accurate for users

## Troubleshooting

### If Risk Assessment Still Shows Default Conditions
1. Check that symptoms are being passed correctly
2. Verify that symptom names match the mapping keys
3. Check console logs for analysis errors

### If Database Initialization Still Fails
1. Check database service configuration
2. Verify that database files are accessible
3. Check for permission issues
4. Review console logs for specific error messages

## Summary

These fixes address the two main issues:
1. **Risk Assessment**: Now provides multiple relevant conditions based on selected symptoms instead of defaulting to "Upper Respiratory Infection"
2. **Database Initialization**: Added robust retry logic and better error handling to ensure health data can be saved successfully

The application should now provide a much better user experience with reliable data saving and more accurate risk assessments.
