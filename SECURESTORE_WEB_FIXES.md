# SecureStore Web Platform Fixes

## Issue Description
The application was showing console errors when running on web platform:
```
❌ AuditLogger: Failed to store audit logs: UnavailabilityError: The method or property SecureStore.setItemAsync is not available on web
```

## Root Cause
Expo's SecureStore is not available on web platforms and was causing errors when the SecurityService tried to store audit logs and encryption keys.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced AuditLogger Storage Logic
**File:** `src/services/SecurityService.ts` (lines 390-418)

**Before:**
- Direct SecureStore.setItemAsync() calls
- Basic AsyncStorage fallback only when encryption keys weren't ready

**After:**
- Try SecureStore first, catch UnavailabilityError
- Fallback to AsyncStorage with encryption when SecureStore fails
- Fallback to AsyncStorage without encryption if encryption keys not ready
- Console fallback as final option
- Improved logging to show which storage method is being used

### 2. Enhanced AuditLogger Loading Logic
**File:** `src/services/SecurityService.ts` (lines 421-469)

**Before:**
- Direct SecureStore.getItemAsync() calls
- No fallback loading mechanism

**After:**
- Try SecureStore first, catch UnavailabilityError
- Try encrypted AsyncStorage fallback
- Try unencrypted AsyncStorage fallback
- Proper error handling and logging
- Support for both encrypted and unencrypted log formats

### 3. Enhanced CryptoManager Decryption
**File:** `src/services/SecurityService.ts` (lines 211-233)

**Before:**
- Direct SecureStore call for old keys during decryption
- No fallback for old key retrieval

**After:**
- Try SecureStore for old keys, fallback to AsyncStorage
- Proper error handling when SecureStore unavailable
- Better error messages for debugging

## Storage Strategy

### Web Platform (SecureStore unavailable)
1. **Encrypted logs** → AsyncStorage (`audit_logs_encrypted`)
2. **Unencrypted logs** → AsyncStorage (`audit_logs_temp`)
3. **Encryption keys** → AsyncStorage (`security_keys_fallback`)
4. **Old encryption keys** → AsyncStorage (`old_security_keys_fallback`)

### Mobile Platform (SecureStore available)
1. **Encrypted logs** → SecureStore (`audit_logs`)
2. **Encryption keys** → SecureStore (`security_keys`)
3. **Old encryption keys** → SecureStore (`old_security_keys`)

## Result
- ✅ No more console errors about SecureStore unavailability
- ✅ Audit logging works seamlessly on web platform
- ✅ Encryption keys are properly stored and retrieved
- ✅ Data decryption works with fallback key storage
- ✅ Graceful degradation from secure to less secure storage
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and logging

## Testing
The fixes have been tested on web platform and show:
- No SecureStore errors in console
- Proper fallback to AsyncStorage
- Successful authentication and app functionality
- Audit logs are stored and retrieved correctly

## Security Considerations
- Web platform uses AsyncStorage (localStorage) which is less secure than SecureStore
- Encryption is still applied when possible
- Fallback to unencrypted storage only when encryption keys unavailable
- This is acceptable for web development/demo purposes
- Production deployments should consider additional security measures for web platform
