# Risk Assessment Feature Documentation

## Overview

The Risk Assessment feature is a comprehensive health analysis system that uses K-means clustering to analyze user symptom patterns and identify potential health conditions. It provides personalized risk assessments, condition probabilities, and actionable recommendations.

## Key Features

### üîç **Symptom Pattern Analysis**
- **K-means Clustering**: Groups similar symptom patterns using advanced machine learning
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies recurring symptom combinations and their characteristics
- **Risk Level Classification**: Categorizes patterns as low, medium, or high risk

### üè• **Condition Identification**
- **Medical Condition Mapping**: Matches symptoms to potential health conditions
- **Probability Scoring**: Calculates likelihood of specific conditions based on symptom patterns
- **Urgency Assessment**: Determines medical urgency (low, medium, high)

### üìä **Comprehensive Health Assessment**
- **Overall Risk Level**: Provides a holistic risk assessment (low, medium, high, critical)
- **Lifestyle Factors**: Analyzes sleep, stress, exercise, and diet quality
- **Trend Analysis**: Tracks symptom frequency, severity, and risk progression over time

### üí° **Personalized Recommendations**

- **Lifestyle Improvements**: Suggestions for better health habits
- **Medical Guidance**: When to seek professional medical attention

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components

#### 1. **RiskAssessmentService** (`src/services/RiskAssessmentService.ts`)
```typescript
export class RiskAssessmentService {
  // Main assessment method
  async performRiskAssessment(userId: string): Promise<RiskAssessment>
  
  // Symptom pattern analysis using K-means
  private async analyzeSymptomPatterns(healthData: any[]): Promise<SymptomPattern[]>
  
  // Condition identification
  private identifyPotentialConditions(patterns: SymptomPattern[]): Condition[]
  
  // Risk level calculation
  private calculateOverallRiskLevel(patterns: SymptomPattern[], conditions: any[]): RiskLevel
}
```

#### 2. **MachineLearningService Integration**
```typescript
// K-means clustering for symptom patterns
async performKMeansClustering(data: any[], k: number = 3): Promise<number[]>

// Feature normalization for clustering
private normalizeFeaturesForClustering(features: number[][]): number[][]
```

#### 3. **RiskAssessmentScreen** (`src/screens/RiskAssessmentScreen.tsx`)
- **Comprehensive UI**: Displays all assessment results in an organized, user-friendly interface
- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded risk levels and urgency badges
- **Interactive Elements**: Pull-to-refresh, loading states, error handling

### Data Flow

1. **Data Collection**: User health data from `DatabaseService`
2. **Feature Extraction**: Convert health records to clustering features
3. **K-means Clustering**: Group similar symptom patterns
4. **Pattern Analysis**: Calculate risk levels and characteristics
5. **Condition Matching**: Compare patterns against medical condition mappings
6. **Risk Assessment**: Generate overall risk level and recommendations
7. **Results Display**: Present findings in the UI

## Condition Mappings

The system includes mappings for common health conditions across multiple categories:

### Respiratory Conditions
- **Upper Respiratory Infection**: cough, sore throat, runny nose, congestion, fever
- **Bronchitis**: persistent cough, chest discomfort, fatigue, shortness of breath
- **Asthma**: wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, cough at night

### Cardiovascular Conditions
- **Hypertension**: headache, dizziness, chest pain, shortness of breath, fatigue

### Mental Health
- **Anxiety**: rapid heartbeat, sweating, trembling, shortness of breath, nausea
- **Stress-Related Symptoms**: headache, muscle tension, fatigue, irritability, sleep problems

### Neurological Conditions
- **Migraine**: severe headache, nausea, sensitivity to light, sensitivity to sound
- **Tension Headache**: headache, neck pain, shoulder tension, eye strain

### Gastrointestinal Conditions
- **Gastritis**: stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, bloating
- **Irritable Bowel Syndrome**: abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, constipation

### Musculoskeletal Conditions
- **Back Pain**: back pain, stiffness, muscle spasms, limited mobility
- **Arthritis**: joint pain, stiffness, swelling, reduced range of motion

### General Conditions
- **Fatigue Syndrome**: fatigue, weakness, difficulty concentrating, sleep problems

## Risk Assessment Algorithm

### 1. **Symptom Pattern Analysis**
```typescript
// Extract features for clustering
const symptomFeatures = healthData.map(record => ({
  severity: record.severity,
  symptomCount: symptoms.length,
  symptomDiversity: uniqueSymptoms / totalSymptoms,
  frequency: symptomOccurrenceInLast7Days,
  timestamp: record.timestamp
}));
```

### 2. **K-means Clustering**
- **Normalization**: Scale features to [0,1] range
- **Clustering**: Group similar patterns using K-means++ algorithm
- **Pattern Classification**: Assign risk levels based on cluster characteristics

### 3. **Condition Matching**
```typescript
const matchScore = (symptomMatch + severityMatch + frequencyMatch) / 3;
if (matchScore > 0.6) {
  // Potential condition identified
}
```

### 4. **Risk Level Calculation**
```typescript
if (criticalConditions > 0 || highRiskPatterns > 2 || avgSeverity > 8) {
  return 'critical';
} else if (highRiskPatterns > 0 || avgSeverity > 6) {
  return 'high';
} else if (avgSeverity > 4) {
  return 'medium';
} else {
  return 'low';
}
```
