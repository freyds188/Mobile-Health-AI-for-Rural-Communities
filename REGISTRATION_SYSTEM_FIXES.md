# Registration System Fixes

## Problem Identified
The registration system had a critical flaw where users were not being properly stored in the database, preventing them from logging in with their registered credentials.

## Root Cause
The DataService had web platform-specific code that created temporary user objects without actually storing them in the database. When users tried to login later, their credentials were not found.

**Problematic Code in `src/services/DataService.ts`:**
```javascript
// Check if we're on web platform and handle registration
if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
  // Created temporary user object but didn't store it
  const webUser = { /* temporary user */ };
  return userProfile; // Returned without storing
}
```

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Fixed Database Storage Issue** âœ…
**File:** `src/services/DataService.ts` (lines 273-275)

**Before:**
- Web platform users were created as temporary objects
- No actual database storage occurred
- Users couldn't login after registration

**After:**
- All users (web and mobile) go through proper DatabaseService
- DatabaseService handles platform-specific storage (SQLite vs localStorage)
- Users are properly stored and can login with their credentials

### 2. **Enhanced Registration Validation** âœ…
**File:** `src/screens/auth/RegisterScreen.tsx` (lines 36-83)

**Improvements:**
- **Email format validation** with regex pattern
- **Comprehensive field validation** with specific error messages
- **Password strength requirements** (minimum 6 characters)
- **Password confirmation matching**
- **Age validation** (1-120 range)
- **Improved user feedback** with descriptive alerts

### 3. **Added Registration Testing Tools** âœ…
**File:** `src/utils/RegistrationTestHelper.ts` (New file)

**Features:**
- **Complete flow testing**: Registration â†’ Authentication â†’ Data integrity
- **Validation scenario testing**: Valid data, duplicates, invalid formats, weak passwords
- **Sample user creation** for easy testing
- **Comprehensive error reporting**

### 4. **Enhanced Login Screen Testing** âœ…
**File:** `src/screens/auth/LoginScreen.tsx` (lines 215-257)

**New Features:**
- **"ðŸ§ª Test Registration & Login"** button
- **End-to-end testing** of registration and login flow
- **Automatic credential filling** after successful test
- **Detailed success/failure reporting**

## Registration Flow Now Works As Follows:

### 1. User Registration:
1. User fills registration form with validation
2. Enhanced validation checks all fields
3. User data is sent to DataService.createUser()
4. **User is properly stored in database** (fixed!)
5. User is automatically logged in
6. User is redirected to main app

### 2. Subsequent Login:
1. User enters registered email and password
2. Credentials are validated against stored database
3. **User is found and authenticated** (now works!)
4. User is logged in and redirected to main app

## Testing Features

### Manual Testing:
- Use the registration form to create a new account
- After auto-login, logout and login again with same credentials
- Should work seamlessly

### Automated Testing:
- Click **"ðŸ§ª Test Registration & Login"** button on login screen
- Creates a test user, verifies storage, tests authentication
- Provides test credentials for manual verification

### Test Scenarios Covered:
- âœ… Valid user registration and login
- âœ… Email format validation
- âœ… Password strength requirements
- âœ… Duplicate email prevention
- âœ… Data integrity verification
- âœ… Cross-platform compatibility

## Database Storage Strategy

### Mobile Platform:
- Uses **SQLite** database for secure local storage
- Full encryption support
- Robust transaction handling

### Web Platform:
- Uses **localStorage** with fallback support
- Maintains same interface as SQLite
- Proper user persistence between sessions

## Validation Rules

### Email:
- Must be valid email format (`user@domain.com`)
- Must be unique (no duplicates)
- Required field

### Password:
- Minimum 6 characters
- Must match confirmation password
- Required field

### Name:
- Required field
- Trimmed of whitespace

### Age:
- Optional field
- Must be between 1-120 if provided

### Other Fields:
- Gender, location, medical history are optional
- All data is properly sanitized and validated

## Security Features

### Password Handling:
- Passwords are hashed using PBKDF2
- Salt is generated for each user
- Plain text passwords are never stored

### Data Validation:
- Input sanitization on all fields
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection

### Audit Logging:
- All registration attempts are logged
- Failed attempts are tracked
- Security events are recorded

## Result

âœ… **Users can now successfully:**
1. **Register** with their credentials
2. **Login** with the same credentials
3. **Access the main application**
4. **Use the app across sessions**

âœ… **System provides:**
1. **Proper data persistence** across platforms
2. **Comprehensive validation** with helpful error messages
3. **Security features** with encryption and audit logging
4. **Testing tools** for verification and debugging

The registration system is now fully functional and allows users to create accounts and use their credentials to sign into the application reliably.
